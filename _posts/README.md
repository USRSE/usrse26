# Posts Feed

This directory can be used to generate timed "posts"
that update on the main page. They have been used in the past
to report on important dates, updates, changes, etc.

The file name for all posts must follow the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`
where the date is the date that the post should post.

All posts must start with:

```
---
layout: post
title: Your title here
date: YYYY-MM-DD
tags: optional
---

(content)

```

If you put a date in the future, the post will not render.
