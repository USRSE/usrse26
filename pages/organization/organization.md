### General Chairs

- Alex Koufos, Stanford University
- Keith Beattie, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory

### We are looking for volunteers for the organizing committee.

We see this as a chance to make it a community-driven event where community members can build the program.
We have several chair positions available, and we aim to have a chair and a co-chair for each role.
We would also like to encourage people who do not have experience in organizing conferences to apply for a position, and we will pair them with a more experienced chair.
It is an opportunity for you to build and demonstrate leadership skills and have deep involvement in community engagement.
Please take under consideration that it is a commitment of about a year with regular meetings starting around January 2026, and additionally the actual tasks for the conference dependent on your role.

As a chair or co-chair, youâ€™ll have the ability to help steer the direction of your piece of the conference.
This might mean building a small sub-team of volunteers or making decisions about the implementation, format, and structure of elements of the conference.

We will select chairs for each role by selecting at least one experienced person for each role.
Each chair will then be paired up with someone who has less experience, if possible, as a co-chair.
You may note your preferences and we try to assign people to their preferred roles.
If we have more applications than roles we can fill in the first step, there will be more opportunities for roles after the committee decides about the format of the conference.
Session chairs are always needed at the conference, for example.
