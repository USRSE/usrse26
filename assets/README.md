# Assets Directory

This directory should contain media assets such
as scripts, images, etc.

Generally speaking, unless there is a change in a dependency or a specific style adjustment needed,
the `js` and `css` folder contents won't change.

Images should be added to the `img` directory, structured however makes
sense. For example,

```
$ tree -d img/
img/
└── sponsor-logos
```

Some standard images are included to start.
